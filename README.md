This is a coding sample using a MVVM design pattern. The project has the following:  
• MVVM Architecture  
• Written in Swift  
• Using UIKit & Auto-Layout  
• Making a network call using Async/Await (Swift 5.5) to fetch Apple Music Top 10 Albums data  
• Displaying results in primary view as a list in a tableview with title and album image; with each row selectable to navigate to a more detailed view and link to the app store  
• Utilizing Image Cache to prevent lag when scrolling
